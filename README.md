Image Stacker 

Overview 
  In this project, CtrlZ (Kimble and Sydney) implemented an image stacking algorithm using PPM! 
  The goal of the algorithm is to average multiple images of the same subject to create one final
  high-quality image. 

Design Decisions 
 
  We created a Stacker class to handle the image stacking. The class includes methods for reading 
  a single PPM file, stacking multiple images, and writing the final product of the stacked image 
  into a new file. Our project consists of three main files: main.cpp, stacker.cpp, and stacker.h. 

Challenges 

  We ran into some challenges along the way while completing this project. For starters, we had to 
  do some research on terms and processes that we were not familiar with. Reading and writing the 
  PPM files was likely our main challenge. Ensuring that the file was opening correctly and was going 
  to the right file path created some difficulty. 

How to Run the Program 

  To run the program, we created prompts for a user to follow. We first ask the user to enter the file 
  of the image they are looking to stack. Then, we ask them to enter a number for the amount of images 
  they would like to stack. An output file based on the image name will then contain the final stacked 
  image. We included multiple error checks to catch and explain issues. 

Partner Collaboration

  We worked on this assignment collaboratively in the computer lab. One of us would actively code, while 
  the other would bounce ideas and assist in debugging. We would switch when needed. We met up three times 
  and would work on it multiple hours at a time.
